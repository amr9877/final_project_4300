# Project Description
For my semester project I am interested in finding coorelations of data between the COVID-19 pandemic and the sales of bottled water from the Nestle coorperation. It is intuitive
to think that because most familys and individuals are quarantining themselves in order to stay away form the virus that they would be buying more household products than
usual during this time of crisis. We are well aware of the effect that COVID-19 has had on toilet paper sales, so it is my objective to detect similar trends, if any exist
concerning bottled water sales.

## Probelm Statement and Motivation
I am motivated to understand more about the effects that COVID-19 is having on the United States as a whole. I believe that learning all we can about global pandemics such as this
one can have positive consequences in the future for when something as devestating as this happens again. Learning about how sales of certain products change during a pandemic can
help prepare us for emergencies in the future.

## Introduction and Description of Data
I plan to use data repositories from both the United States Federal government concerning COVID-19 case data as well as Nestle's US sales data. I believe combining these two data sets
and comparing them should be a complicated and somewhat arduous task because finding patters within both sets of data that line up correctly will be tough. However, I am 
confident that if patterns in the data exists, I will be able to find and compare them to draw clear conclusions to the effect of COVID-19 on bottle water sales.

# Plan
- October/November - Aggregate data sets and clean them for comparison.
- November - Create code to fully display and understand data being compared.
- November/December - Finish project and polish with descriptions. Prepare to port project to website from Jupyter Notebook.
- December - Submit project with all findings and research.
